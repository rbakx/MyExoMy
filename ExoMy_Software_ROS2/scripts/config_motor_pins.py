Motor Configuration

This scripts leads you through the configuration of the motors.
First we have to find out, to which pin of the PWM board a motor is connected.
Look closely which motor moves and type in the answer.

Ensure to run the script until the end, otherwise your changes will not be saved!
This script can always be stopped with ctrl+c and restarted.
All other controls will be explained in the process.
